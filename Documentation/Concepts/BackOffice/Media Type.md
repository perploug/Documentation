## What is a Media Type?
A Media Type is basically the same as a [Document Type]. I.e. a model / data definition for your media nodes.

You can set icon, thumbnail and description. It is also possible to add tabs and properties.

A Media Type differs from a Document Type in that you cannot set a Media Type to be "Inheritable Only". A Media Type also has no template.
