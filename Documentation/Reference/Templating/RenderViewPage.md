#RenderViewPage
RenderViewPage is the class inherited by all Partials. It contains references to the current page, access to Hive for queries and the RequestContext. `RenderViewPage` inherits from the standard MVC class `System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage`
	
##Usage
Use `RenderViewPage` to access the page, hive or Request context in your Partials or templates. Both templates and partials inherit from this class, and the syntax is the same, as both partials and templates are based on Razor.

	@inherits RenderViewPage
	@using Umbraco.Cms.Web;
	@using Umbraco.Hive.RepositoryTypes;
		
	@{
	    //get a hive writer from Hive
	    var hiveWriter = Hive.GetWriter<IContentStore>();
	
	    //Get the path to the backoffice with the RequestContext
	    var backofficeFolder = RoutableRequestContext.Application.Settings.UmbracoFolders.BackOfficeFolder;
	
	    //get url from from currentPage from Umbraco helper
	    var url = Umbraco.GetUrl(DynamicModel);
	
	    //get field from current page
	    var field = Umbraco.Field("bodyText");
	}
